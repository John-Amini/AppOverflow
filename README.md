Hi! Welcome to AppOverflow!

    In order to search, read questions, answers, and comments you do not need to be logged in. The main page displays a list of recently updated questions that recently recieved a new answer or comment. Searching can be done through the search bar at the top.

    Now in order to answer, comment or ask a question you need to be logged in. If you don't have an account already you need to go to the Sign up page initially in order to create an account. If you have an acount instead go to the log in page.

    After logging in go to the ask question page and ask your question while leaving some context. However, if you instead want to answer a question or leave a comment on an answer or even vote on an answer go to that specific questions details page. There you can do all of those things as long as you are still logged in.

    If you ever want to delete or edit any questions, answers, or comments you might own just hit the corresponding buttons associated with those buttons.
